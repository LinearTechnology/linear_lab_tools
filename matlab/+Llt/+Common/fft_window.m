function win = fft_window(n, window_type)
% Generates a window for reducing sidelobes due to FFT of incoherently sampled data.
% 
% Window type is a case INsensitive string and can be one of:
%   'Hamming', 'Hann', 'Blackman', 'BlackmanExact', 'BlackmanHarris70',
%   'FlatTop', 'BlackmanHarris92'
% The default window type is 'BlackmanHarris92'

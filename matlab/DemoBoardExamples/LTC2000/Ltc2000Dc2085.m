% DC2085 / LTC2000 Interface Example
% LTC2000: 16-/14-/11- Bit 2.5 Gsps DAcs
%
% This program demonstrates how to communicate with the LTC2000 demo board 
% using Matlab. Examples are provided for generating sinusoidal data from within
% the program, as well as writing and reading pattern data from a file.
% 
% Board setup is described in Demo Manual 2085. Follow the procedure in 
% this manual, and verify operation with the LTDACGen software. Once 
% operation is verified, exit LTDACGen and run this script.

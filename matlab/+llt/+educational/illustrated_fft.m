% first, let's make a sinewave with some noise:
bin_number = 2.0;
amplitude = 1.0;
mu = 0;
sigma = 0.1;

num_bins = 32; % This is also the number of points in the time record
data = zeros(1, num_bins);

noise = sigma.*randn(num_bins,1) + mu;

% Generate some input data
for i = 1:num_bins
    data(i)= amplitude * sin(2 * pi * bin_number * i / num_bins);
    data(i) = data(i) + noise(i);
end
    
% And lets take its FFT using MATLAB's FFT function, and tuck it away for later
fft_magnitude = abs(fft(data) / length(data));

% Okay, now let's deconstruct the FFT a bit. And by "a bit", we mean "a LOT!"
% We've already got the data that we
% want to analyze, so the next step is to make two, 2-d arrays of "test sinusoids"
% where one consists of cosines to detect the real part of a frequency component,
% and the other consists of sines to detect the imaginary part:

test_cosines = zeros(num_bins, num_bins);
test_sines = zeros(num_bins, num_bins);
for freq = 1 : num_bins
    for time = 1: num_bins
        test_cosines(freq, time) = cos(2*pi * (freq-1) * time / num_bins);
        test_sines(freq, time) = sin(2*pi * (freq-1) * time / num_bins);
    end
end

% The next step is to multiply the "test sinusoids" by the original data, one
% frequency at a time to see if "anybody's home". You actually only need to
% "multiply and accumulate", such that one test sinusoid will produce a single
% number. But we want to plot the results, so we're going to construct arrays
% (the "multiply" part) and then sum the elements (the "accumulate" part.)

result_cosines = zeros(num_bins, num_bins);
result_sines = zeros(num_bins, num_bins);

for freq = 1 : num_bins
    result_cosines(freq, 1:32) = test_cosines(freq, 1:32) .* data(1:32);
    result_sines(freq, 1:32) = test_sines(freq, 1:32) .* data(1:32);
end

% This is the final step! Sum the elements of the result arrays, which gives
% you the real and imaginary parts of the DFT:
real_part = zeros(1, num_bins);
imag_part = zeros(1, num_bins);

for freq = 1 : num_bins
    real_part(freq) = sum(result_cosines(freq, 1:32));
    imag_part(freq) = sum(result_sines(freq, 1:32));
end
% Calculate magnitude of each frequency component (considering real and imaginary parts)
for freq = 1:32
    magnitude(freq) = sqrt(real_part(freq) ^ 2 + imag_part(freq) ^ 2);

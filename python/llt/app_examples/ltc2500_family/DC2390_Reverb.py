# The following routines read and write registers in the FPGA. These can be
# either read or write (or both), depending on the exact design.
# But fundamentally, when reading or writing a register from a script such as
# this one, you are reading or setting the state of a signal in the FPGA design.
# The addresses of the registers we will be talking to are defined in
# DC2390_functions.py, imported above. If you open it up, you will see these lines:
#
REV_ID_BASE = 0x10
LED_BASE = 0x40

DATAPATH_CONTROL_BASE = 0xD0
FEEDBACK_FACTOR_BASE = 0xF0

datapath_word_lut_continuous = 0x00000000 #counter as LUT address, run once


# Here, we use the reg_read() function to read the register that contains
# the FPGA bitfile's type and revision. This allows us to keep track of
# lots of projects, and software (such as this script) can verify that it's
# talking to the correct FPGA code. It's a 32-bit wide register, with the type
# in the lower 16-bits and the revision in the upper 16-bits.
# The reg_read takes the register address as the argument, and returns the
# value read out.

# In the FPGA design, this register is an input, with these values hard-coded.
# Other input registers are used to monitor other signals that may change,
# such as the status of an ADC capture.

# Next, we use the reg_write() function to blink a light! LED0 is connected to
# the least significant bit of register 0x40, and writing a "1" will turn the
# light on. reg_write takes the register address as the first argument, and the
# value to write as the second argument.

# "client.shutdown()" in the Python console

# What client.shutdown() really does is execute the command:
# "shutdown -h now"
# on the SoCkit board.

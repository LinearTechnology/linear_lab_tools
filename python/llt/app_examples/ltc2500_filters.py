LTC2500_filters.py

This script imports the LTC2500-32 digital filter coefficents and plots the
impulse responses and frequency responses.
It then calculates the "effective noise bandwidth" in two ways, by measuring
the filter's effect on a set of random data, and by direct integration of the
frequency response.

Tested with Python 2.7, Anaconda distribution available from Continuum Analytics,

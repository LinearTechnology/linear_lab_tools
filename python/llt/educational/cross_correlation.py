Welcome to the LinearLabTools simulation of a basic cross-correlation noise
measurement. This technique is used in phase noise measurements, where the 
instrument noise is greater than the noise of the device under test. The
way around this is to make TWO instrument paths, whose noise will be uncorrelated.
The instrument path outputs will have a correlated component due to the common DUT
noise at the input.

This program shows how to extract the correlated component

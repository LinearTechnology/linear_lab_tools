Welcome to the LTPyLab simulation of basic FFT operation, SNR calculation
Basically, we're making a vector of num_bins time domain
samples, then corrupting the signal in several "real world" ways:

1) Thermal noise is added to the signal, which is just a random
number with a gaussian distribution. This is often referred to as the
"transition noise" of an ADC, and it can never be smaller than K*T/C where
K is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature, and C is the size of the
ADC's sample capacitor.

2) Quantization noise is added by simply starting with a signal of amplitude
2^(number of bits), then truncating the decimal portion with the int function

3) Random jitter is added to the sample clock. This is an accurate model of
wideband clock jitter that is spread across seveal Nyquist bands

3) Deterministic jitter is added to the sample clock, representing phase noise
at a particular frequency. This gives an intuitive understanding of the effect
of phase noise as a signal's frequency and amplitude change.

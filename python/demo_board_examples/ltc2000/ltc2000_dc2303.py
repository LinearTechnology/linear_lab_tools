DC2085 / LTC2000 Interface Example
This program demonstrates how to communicate with the LTC2000 demo board through Python.
Examples are provided for generating sinusoidal data from within the program, as well
as writing and reading pattern data from a file.

Board setup is described in Demo Manual 2085. Follow the procedure in this manual, and
verify operation with the LTDACGen software. Once operation is verified, exit LTDACGen
and run this script.

Tested with Python 2.7, Anaconda distribution available from Continuum Analytics,
http://www.continuum.io/

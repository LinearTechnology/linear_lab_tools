DC1369 / LTC2261 Interface Example

This program demonstrates how to communicate with the LTC2261 demo board through Python.
Examples are provided for reading data captured by the ADC, or test data generated by
the ADC.

Board setup is described in Demo Manual 1369. Follow the procedure in this manual, and
verify operation with the PScope software. Once operation is verified, exit PScope
and run this script.

Tested with Python 2.7, Anaconda distribution available from Continuum Analytics,
http://www.continuum.io/
